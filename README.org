* Welcome!
My name is Brandon Irizarry. I'm an aspiring software developer based
in New York City.

You've reached my eponymous Github account; it houses a collection of
various things I've worked on.

Currently, I'm learning full-stack Web development with [[https://www.theodinproject.com][The Odin
Project]]. With time, more projects will appear here (and certain old,
obsolete ones will be pruned away.)
