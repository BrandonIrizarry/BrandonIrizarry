About Me
-

Based in NYC. Interested in software-based solutions as both a
pragmatic problem-solving tool, and as a medium of creative
expression. I relish the opportunity to learn and go in depth on new
and interesting technologies (sometimes not so new!)

Languages for which I've written a reasonably extensive amount of
code in:

- Python
- Java
- Go
- Lua
- Emacs Lisp

Languages that I otherwise have some kind of abiding interest in:

- C
- Forth
- Lisp in its various dialects

I've also recently started maintaining a [blog](https://brandonirizarry.xyz).
