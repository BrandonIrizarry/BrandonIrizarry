## About Me
A guy interested in becoming more involved in the tech sphere.

I mostly gravitate towards weird languages like Lisp (I currently
write Emacs Lisp stuff sometimes when I'm bored.) I've studied and
greatly enjoyed Forth in the past, though I've forgotten much of it
now.

However, in terms of more in-vogue stuff, I've lately been picking up
and enjoying Kotlin, because of its pragmatism (for example, avoiding
nullability as much as possible while still making it opt-in.) I also
enjoy Kotlin's strong static type system, something I came to love
when playing around with SML a while back. To this end, I'm brushing
up on Java, since:

- It's an important language in its own right. For example, the
  popularity of the Spring Boot backend framework attests to
  this. Also:

- Kotlin is heavily predicated on the JVM, and consequently the
  default user experience involves constantly falling back to existing
  Java libraries. It also inherits certain limitations from Java (for
  example, type erasure), and the way in which we write multi-threaded
  Kotlin code (as opposed to using coroutines) is basically lifted
  completely from Java.

I look forward to learning more things (for example, Python, Go) as
the opportunity arises! I have an eye especially on being able to
write Android apps in the future.
