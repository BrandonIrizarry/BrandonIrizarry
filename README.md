About Me
-

Based in NYC. Interested in software-based solutions as both a
pragmatic problem-solving tool, and as a medium of creative
expression. I relish the opportunity to learn and go in depth on new
and interesting technologies (sometimes not so new!)

Languages that I've either written extensive code in, or else have an
interest in:

- Python
- Java
- Go
- Lua
- C
- Emacs Lisp

I've also recently started maintaining a [blog](https://brandonirizarry.xyz).
