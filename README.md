### About Me
A guy interested in becoming more involved in the tech sphere.

I mostly gravitate towards weird languages like Lisp (I currently
write Emacs Lisp stuff sometimes when I'm bored.) I've studied and
greatly enjoyed Forth in the past, though I've forgotten much of it
now.

However, in terms of more in-vogue stuff, I've lately been picking up
and enjoying Kotlin, because of its pragmatism (avoiding nullability
as much as possible while still making it opt-in.) To this end, I'm
brushing up on Java, since it's an important language.
