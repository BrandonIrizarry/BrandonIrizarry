About Me
-

Based in NYC. Interested in hardware and software-based solutions as
both a pragmatic problem-solving tool, and as a medium of creative
expression.

Languages that I've either written extensive code in, or else have an
interest in:

- Python
- Java
- Go
- Lua
- C
- Emacs Lisp

I also maintain a [blog](https://brandonirizarry.xyz), where I write about various topics,
mostly of a technical nature.
